For the first part of the project, created a cloud relational database using Amazon Web Services (AWS) and connected our database using a PostgreSQL. We then created four tables in our RDS using the scheme provided. Finall, we extracted Amazon review dataset regarding video game reviews, transformed the data based on the directions provided for the Challenge and then uploaded the data into our cloud database tables. We used postgreSQL to create our tables and PySpark for the ETL process.
